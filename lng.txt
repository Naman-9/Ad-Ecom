1. Quick Tip: (üí°React Router Dom Tip ) 
2. Error while Deleting A Product - 2:58:55 
3. Stripe Card Payment Error - 5:08:54
4. Product Stock not updating after Order placed - 5:19:48

üëâ1. React Router Dom Tip : 
If you currently this path `/admin/product/new` for creat a new product and then after  product  successfully created, you wanted to navigate the user to previous path `/admin/product` - 2:38:38 don't write it down this way
`navigate("/admin/product")` - 2:38:38
just use two dots. for go back to previous path
`navigate("..")`  or `navigate(-1)` - 2:37:05
you can also add an option, how you want to go back "path" or "route"
`navigate("..", { relative : "path" })` - 2:37:05
‚ÑπPlease Read react router dom docs for more info

üëâ2. Error while Deleting A Product : - 2:58:55
While deleting a product if you get an error on browser console or in terminal (400 status ) then it happen only because invalidate tag in delete product.
After deleting the product it‚Äôs still refetching the product that‚Äôs why 400 bad request come in console.
To prevent this just add another tag in your tagType (e.g. ‚ÄúallProduct‚Äù)
Add this tag in all providers tag except product detail (Don‚Äôt need while deleting product )
And make sure to remove ‚Äòproduct‚Äô invalidate tag from delete product

 üëâ3. Stripe Card Payment Error - 5:08:54

‚õîERROR‚õî

üëâ4. Product Stock not updating after Order placed - 5:19:48
After Order Placed and navigate to orders then go to all products in /admin/product and you can see product stock not 
change.
That because after order placed update product cache not Invalidate that's why in all product new data not fetching
If you refresh you can see the updated stock in your products

To Resolve this Problem, in product page from `useAllProductsQuery` hooks call refetch function and use it in useEffects for force to refetch data.
But this way everytime when you open the product page data refetch. So we don't wanted that. To Fix this
    ‚ñ´Create a boolean state in your cartReducer initialState named e.g. `isRefetch` and default value `false`.
    ‚ñ´Create a action called `refetchProduct`  code üëáüëá
                      ``` 
                          refetchProduct: (state, action: PayloadAction<boolean>) => {
                               state.isRefetch = action.payload;
                          }
                     ```
    ‚ñ´In checkout page after `dispatch(resetCart())` add this call this action => `dispatch(refetchProduct(true))`
    ‚ñ´Back in product page called `isRefetch` from   cartReducer and add dependency in useEffect and before mount the Data
           add this line 
                  ``` 
                       if (isRefetch) refetch();
                       dispatch(refetchProduct(false));
                  ```
